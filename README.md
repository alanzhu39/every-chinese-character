# Every Chinese Character Bot
A Twitter bot that tweets every simplified Chinese character with Mandarin pinyin. Task completed in 2022.

## Sources
Characters are taken from the Table of General Standard Chinese Characters (通用规范汉字表; Tōngyòng Guīfàn Hànzì Biǎo). Character database was downloaded from [http://hanzidb.org/character-list/general-standard](http://hanzidb.org/character-list/general-standard).

Mandarin pinyin was downloaded from the Unihan database ([https://unicode.org/charts/unihan.html](https://unicode.org/charts/unihan.html)).
